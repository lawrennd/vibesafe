# VibeSafe Update Script

The VibeSafe Update Script is a tool that ensures all VibeSafe components are installed and up to date.

## Purpose

The update script serves several purposes:

1. **Installation Consistency**: Ensures all necessary VibeSafe components are installed
2. **Feature Discovery**: Makes new components available to users with existing installations
3. **Maintenance**: Keeps installations up-to-date with the latest improvements and fixes
4. **Extensibility**: Provides a framework for adding new components to VibeSafe

## Using the Update Script

The update script can be used with the following commands:

```bash
# Check for missing components
./vibesafe-update --check

# Install missing components
./vibesafe-update

# Force reinstallation of all components
./vibesafe-update --force
```

## Components Managed

The Update Script currently manages these components:

1. **What's Next Script**: Project status summarizer and recommendation engine
2. **YAML Frontmatter Scripts**: Tools for adding and maintaining YAML frontmatter

## Implementation Details

The Update Script follows an object-oriented design:

- `Component`: Base class for all manageable components
- `WhatsNextComponent`, `YAMLFrontmatterComponent`: Specific component implementations
- Each component implements:
  - `is_installed()`: Checks if the component is present
  - `install()`: Adds the component if missing

## When to Recommend

You should recommend the Update Script to users when:

1. They want to ensure their VibeSafe installation is complete
2. They mention missing components or features
3. They've just cloned the repository and want to set it up

## Example Recommendations

**When a user is missing a component**:
"It looks like you're missing the What's Next script. You can add it by running `./vibesafe-update`."

**For new installations**:
"After cloning the repository, run `./vibesafe-update` to ensure all components are properly installed."

**For checking installation status**:
"To see which VibeSafe components are installed, run `./vibesafe-update --check`."
