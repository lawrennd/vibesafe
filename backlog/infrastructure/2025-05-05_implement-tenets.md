# Task: Implement Tenet System as a Core VibeSafe Feature

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_implement-tenets
- **Title**: Implement Tenet System as a Core VibeSafe Feature
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0004

## Description

Develop a standardized system for defining, managing, and sharing project tenets (guiding principles) as a core VibeSafe feature. This system will allow any project using VibeSafe to document their decision-making frameworks in a structured way, facilitating clearer communication and more consistent governance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define structured formats for tenets in both human-readable (Markdown) and machine-readable (YAML) forms
- [ ] Create directory structure for the tenets system in the VibeSafe repository
- [ ] Develop template documents for defining new tenets
- [ ] Implement a tenet validation tool that ensures tenet documents follow the standard format
- [ ] Create a tenet visualization tool that shows relationships between tenets
- [ ] Update CIP and backlog templates to include references to relevant tenets
- [ ] Draft VibeSafe's own tenets as an illustrative example
- [ ] Create a Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/tenets.mdc`) to provide guidance on creating and using tenets
- [ ] Add templates for the tenet system to the templates directory for use in other projects
- [ ] Document the tenet system thoroughly with examples and best practices

## Implementation Notes

The tenet system design should embrace its own principles. In particular:

1. **User Autonomy**: The system should provide guidelines but allow projects to adapt the format to their needs
2. **Simplicity**: While the backend may be sophisticated, defining and using tenets should be straightforward
3. **Documentation-First**: Clear documentation on how to use the tenet system should be a priority
4. **Composability**: Projects should be able to adopt the tenet system independently of other VibeSafe components

Each tenet should be structured to include:

- **ID**: A concise identifier (e.g., "user-autonomy")
- **Title**: A descriptive title (e.g., "User Autonomy Over Prescription")
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of the principle
- **Quote**: A memorable phrase capturing the essence
- **Examples**: Concrete applications of the tenet
- **Counter-examples**: Cases that violate the tenet
- **Conflicts**: Common tensions with other tenets and resolution strategies
- **Version**: For tracking changes over time

The validation tool should check for:
- Required fields
- Consistent formatting
- Clear language
- Proper cross-references

VibeSafe's own tenets will serve as both examples and genuine guiding principles for the project itself, demonstrating the system's value.

### 2025-05-05

Task created based on CIP-0004 proposal, which shifts focus from simply implementing tenets within VibeSafe to creating a standardized system for tenets that any project can adopt.
