# Task: Develop Testing Framework for VibeSafe Installation Methods

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_installation-testing-plan
- **Title**: Develop Testing Framework for VibeSafe Installation Methods
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0002, 2025-05-05_easy-installation-method

## Description

**üìù SCOPE UPDATED for CIP-000E Clean Installation Philosophy**

To ensure the reliability of VibeSafe installation methods across different environments, we need a simplified testing framework that focuses on the core preserve/overwrite behavior defined in CIP-000E.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Updated for CIP-000E simplified approach:**

- [ ] Design simplified test matrix for core preserve/overwrite behavior
- [ ] Create automated tests for installation script on different OS
- [ ] ~~Create automated tests for Python installation method~~ (removed - shell script only)
- [ ] ~~Implement test cases for selective component installation~~ (removed - always install everything)
- [ ] Test overwrite/preserve behavior on existing installations
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Create documentation on how to run tests locally
- [ ] Establish a regular testing schedule (e.g., weekly, on pull requests, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Simplified Test Matrix (CIP-000E)

The test matrix should cover:

1. **Operating Systems**:
   - Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)
   - macOS (latest 2 versions)
   - Windows (with Git Bash, WSL, PowerShell)

2. **Installation Methods**:
   - Shell script installation (`install-minimal.sh`)
   - One-line curl/wget installation
   - Manual download and execution

3. **Core Scenarios**:
   - Fresh installation (empty directory)
   - Reinstall over existing VibeSafe (verify overwrite/preserve rules)
   - Installation in project with existing content

4. **Preserve/Overwrite Verification**:
   - System files are always overwritten (templates, system READMEs, cursor rules)
   - User content is always preserved (project README, user tasks/CIPs/tenets)
   - Virtual environment is preserved for performance

### Testing Approach

1. **Shell Script Testing**:
   - Use Docker containers for cross-OS testing
   - Create test fixture repositories for different scenarios
   - Verify correct file creation, permissions, and configuration
   - Test error handling with intentionally problematic environments

2. **Python Script Testing**:
   - Test with multiple Python versions (3.6+)
   - Verify enhanced functionality works correctly (compared to shell script)
   - Test with virtual environments
   - Unit tests for core functions

3. **Automated Testing Schedule**:
   - Run basic tests on every pull request
   - Run full test matrix weekly
   - Run full test matrix before releases
   - Manual testing for major releases on physical machines

### Enhanced Python Installation Features to Test

In addition to the basic functionality shared with the shell script:

- Compatibility verification
- Interactive mode with user prompts
- Configuration file generation
- Advanced customization options
- Project integration features
- Template customization
