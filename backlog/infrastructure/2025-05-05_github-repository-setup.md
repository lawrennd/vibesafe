## Description

To make VibeSafe publicly accessible and collaborative, we need to set up a GitHub repository. This will serve as the central location for the project, allowing others to access templates, contribute improvements, and create issues for feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a public GitHub repository named "vibesafe"
- [ ] Set up appropriate repository description and topics
- [ ] Add necessary documentation in the GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules for main branch
- [ ] Set up issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for additional documentation if needed
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines

## Implementation Notes

The repository should follow GitHub best practices, including clear README, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct. All templates should be properly organized and documented to make it easy for new users to understand how to use them.
