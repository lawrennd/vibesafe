## Description

To streamline the project management workflow, we need to implement better integration between VibeSafe's backlog system and GitHub issues. This would allow teams to automatically sync issues between the two systems and maintain consistency across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a script to import GitHub issues into VibeSafe backlog format
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to link existing backlog items to GitHub issues
- [ ] Add support for updating GitHub issues when backlog items are modified
- [ ] Create documentation on how to use the GitHub integration features
- [ ] Ensure the integration works with both public and private repositories

## Implementation Notes

The implementation should use GitHub's REST API to interact with issues. Authentication will be handled using GitHub tokens, which should be stored securely. The integration should be designed to work as both a standalone script and as part of the existing backlog tooling.

Potential technologies:
- Python with requests library for API interaction
- GitHub Action for automated synchronization
- Simple config file for project-specific settings
