# Task: Implement Backlog Integration for AI-Requirements Framework

## Metadata
- **ID**: 2025-05-08_ai-requirements-backlog-integration
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0009, ai-requirements foundation

## Description

Create comprehensive backlog integration for the AI-Requirements framework, allowing requirements to be linked to and generate backlog items. This integration should follow patterns similar to the existing CIP integration but focus on the specific needs of task-level requirements.

## Background

The AI-Requirements framework (CIP-0009) includes integration with CIPs, but needs similar integration with the backlog system to provide end-to-end traceability from requirements to implementation tasks. This task was identified during a self-referential requirements gathering session where we used the framework to plan its own further development.

## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements from our requirements conversation:
- "Implement backlog integration similar to CIP integration"
- "Address prioritization and estimation for backlog items derived from requirements"
- "Define a schema for requirements metadata in backlog items"
- "Maintain bidirectional traceability (requirements to tasks and vice versa)"

## Detailed Tasks

1. Create `ai-requirements/integrations/backlog-integration.md` with:
   - Documentation on how requirements connect to backlog tasks
   - Template for backlog items derived from requirements
   - Guidelines for estimating and prioritizing requirement-based tasks
   - Traceability mechanisms between requirements and tasks

2. Create `ai-requirements/integrations/common/` directory with:
   - `traceability.md`: Common traceability patterns for both CIPs and backlog items
   - `status-sync.md`: Synchronization of status between requirements and their implementations

3. Update example templates to demonstrate backlog task creation from requirements

4. Create a real example by generating backlog tasks for Phase 2 of the framework development

## Acceptance Criteria

This task will be considered complete when:

1. Documentation for backlog integration is complete and follows the same format as CIP integration
2. A backlog template for requirement-derived tasks is available
3. At least one real backlog item (beyond this one) has been created using the framework
4. Bidirectional links between requirements and backlog items are demonstrated
5. Guidelines for estimation and prioritization are included
6. Common traceability components are extracted for reuse with both CIP and backlog integration

## Reference Materials

- CIP-0009: Requirements Conversation Framework
- Existing `ai-requirements/integrations/cip-integration.md`
- `ai-requirements/examples/framework-self-development.md`
