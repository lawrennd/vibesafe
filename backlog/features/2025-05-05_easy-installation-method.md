# Task: Implement Easy Installation Method for VibeSafe

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_easy-installation-method
- **Title**: Implement Easy Installation Method for VibeSafe
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0002

## Description

**⚠️ SUPERSEDED by `2025-07-26_clean-installation-implementation.md`**

This task proposed implementing the complex installation methods from CIP-0002, but has been superseded by a simpler approach in CIP-000E that treats every installation as a "reinstall" with clear preserve/overwrite rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create shell script (`install-vibesafe.sh`) for one-line installation
- [ ] Create Python script (`install_vibesafe.py`) as an alternative
- [ ] Support selective component installation (backlog, CIP, cursor rules)
- [ ] Test installation on different operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Support both new installations and updates to existing installations
- [ ] Add scripts to VibeSafe repository
- [ ] Update main README.md with installation instructions
- [ ] Create example documentation for different installation scenarios

## Implementation Notes

The installation scripts should be designed to work with minimal dependencies, preferring tools that are commonly available on development machines:

1. **Shell Script Requirements:**
   - Should work with bash (and possibly other shells)
   - Should have fallback mechanisms if certain tools are not available
   - Should handle errors gracefully with helpful messages

2. **Python Script Requirements:**
   - Should work with Python 3.6+
   - Should use only the standard library (no external dependencies)
   - Should provide the same functionality as the shell script

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Test on clean environments
   - Test on repositories with existing VibeSafe installations
   - Test with different configuration options

Task created based on CIP-0002 proposal. The CIP contains a draft implementation of the shell script that serves as a starting point.
