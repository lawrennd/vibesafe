# Task: Implement Requirements-CIP Integration

## Description

Create the integration mechanism between requirements and CIPs to ensure traceability, status synchronization, and cohesive workflow between the two artifact types. This includes updating templates, implementing cross-referencing capabilities, and enhancing the What's Next script to check for proper integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update CIP template to include "Related Requirements" section
- [ ] Update requirements template to reference CIPs consistently
- [ ] Implement status synchronization between requirements and CIPs
- [ ] Enhance What's Next script to check for requirements-CIP consistency
- [ ] Create documentation with examples of proper integration
- [ ] Implement traceability visualization (optional)

## Implementation Notes

The implementation should focus on:

1. Ensuring consistent metadata across both document types
2. Maintaining bidirectional links between requirements and CIPs
3. Standardizing status workflows to keep artifacts synchronized
4. Making the integration lightweight and easy to maintain

The integration should work with minimal overhead for users and support existing workflows without major disruption.
