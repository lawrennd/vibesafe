## Description

The current README provides a good overview of VibeSafe, but it would be more helpful to include concrete examples of how to use the CIP and Backlog systems in practice. This task involves enhancing the README with practical examples to make it easier for new users to understand how to apply these systems in their projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add an example of creating and using a CIP
- [ ] Add an example of creating and tracking a task in the backlog system
- [ ] Include sample terminal commands for common operations
- [ ] Add screenshots or diagrams illustrating the workflow
- [ ] Update the "How to Use VibeSafe" section with these examples

## Implementation Notes

Examples should be simple and easy to follow, focusing on the most common use cases. Consider creating a small demonstration project to illustrate the complete workflow from task creation to completion.
