# Task: Evaluate Documentation Systems Compatible with VibeSafe Tenets

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_documentation-system-evaluation
- **Title**: Evaluate Documentation Systems Compatible with VibeSafe Tenets
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0005

## Description

Evaluate documentation systems (like Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus, etc.) that would enhance VibeSafe's documentation while respecting our tenets, particularly "User Autonomy Over Prescription" and "Simplicity at All Levels." The goal is to identify a documentation system that we could use internally without forcing users to adopt the same system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research at least 5 documentation systems, considering:
  - Ease of installation and use
  - Compatibility with Markdown (our current format)
  - Minimal dependencies and requirements
  - Ability to generate static sites
  - Search functionality
  - Customization capabilities
  - Maturity and community support

- [ ] Evaluate each system against our tenets, with particular focus on:
  - User Autonomy: Does it allow flexibility in how documentation is structured?
  - Simplicity: Is it simple to set up and use without excessive dependencies?
  - Documentation as First-Class Citizen: Does it enhance our documentation capabilities?

- [ ] Create a comparison matrix of systems with pros/cons analysis

- [ ] Develop an implementation plan that uses a documentation system internally while preserving user freedom:
  - How VibeSafe can use the system for its own documentation
  - How templates could incorporate documentation without requiring the system
  - How users can benefit from the system without being forced to use it

- [ ] Document a recommendation with rationale

## Implementation Notes

The key challenge is balancing the benefit of a structured documentation system with our tenet of not imposing architectural choices on users. Consider a layered approach where:

1. Raw Markdown files remain the base level documentation format
2. The documentation system provides enhanced features when available
3. Documentation is consumable both with and without the system

An ideal solution would allow raw Markdown to be the source of truth, with the documentation system providing additional features as an optional enhancement.

Consider lightweight systems that can be easily installed alongside VibeSafe without introducing significant dependencies or complexity.
