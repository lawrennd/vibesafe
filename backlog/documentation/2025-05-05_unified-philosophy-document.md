# Task: Create Unified Philosophy Document Based on CIP-0008

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_unified-philosophy-document
- **Title**: Create Unified Philosophy Document Based on CIP-0008
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0008

## Description

Implement the first part of CIP-0008 by creating a unified philosophy document that combines the content from `about.md` and `philosophy.md`. The document should provide a cohesive explanation of VibeSafe's philosophical foundations, connecting to both the "Requirements are All You Need" and "The Human Visual System Can Inspire New Interaction Paradigms for LLMs" papers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a unified `philosophy.md` document that:
  - Combines content from the existing `about.md` and `philosophy.md` files
  - Ensures smooth narrative flow and eliminates redundancies
  - Maintains all key concepts from both source documents
  - Adds references to the proposed new tenets from CIP-0008
  - Follows VibeSafe's documentation standards

- [ ] Update all relevant references to point to the new unified document

- [ ] Ensure the document is accessible from the README.md

- [ ] Gather feedback from team members on the unified document

## Implementation Notes

The unified document should maintain the core narrative structure while eliminating duplicate concepts. Consider organizing the document into these sections:

1. Introduction - VibeSafe's overall philosophical approach
2. Relationship to "Requirements are All You Need" 
3. Relationship to "The Human Visual System" paper
4. How VibeSafe implements these concepts in practice
5. Future directions

The task doesn't include implementing the new tenets yet, as those will be handled separately after CIP-0008 is accepted.
