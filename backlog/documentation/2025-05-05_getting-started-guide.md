## Description

Develop a comprehensive "Getting Started" guide for VibeSafe that helps new users quickly understand and implement VibeSafe practices in their projects. The guide should provide a clear, step-by-step approach to adopting VibeSafe, focusing on practical implementation rather than theory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a concise introduction to VibeSafe's purpose and benefits
- [ ] Develop a step-by-step guide for implementing VibeSafe from scratch:
  - Setting up the directory structure
  - Initializing each system (CIP, Backlog, Tenets)
  - Adapting templates to specific project needs
- [ ] Include a complete end-to-end example:
  - Starting with an empty project
  - Adding VibeSafe components
  - Creating initial tenets
  - Setting up first CIP
  - Adding initial backlog tasks
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- [ ] Create "quick start" scripts to automate setup
- [ ] Include visuals (diagrams, screenshots) to illustrate the process

## Implementation Notes

The guide should follow the principle of "show, don't tell" with concrete examples throughout. It should be approachable for users who are new to structured project management while still being valuable to experienced developers.

Consider creating different paths for different user types (individual developers, small teams, large organizations) and different levels of adoption (minimal, standard, comprehensive).

The guide should embody our tenets, particularly "Simplicity at All Levels" and "Documentation as First-Class Citizen."
