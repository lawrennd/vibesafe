## Description

Develop a comprehensive documentation style guide that establishes standards for all VibeSafe documentation. This guide will ensure consistency across all documentation and help contributors create high-quality documentation that aligns with our "Documentation as First-Class Citizen" tenet.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define writing style standards (tone, voice, formatting)
- [ ] Establish templates for different documentation types (guides, tutorials, reference)
- [ ] Create guidelines for documenting options and alternatives
- [ ] Define standards for examples and code snippets
- [ ] Include guidelines for documentation organization and structure
- [ ] Provide checklist for documentation reviews
- [ ] Include examples of good and poor documentation

## Implementation Notes

The style guide should be practical and actionable, not just theoretical. It should include concrete examples and templates that contributors can easily follow. Consider reviewing documentation style guides from other open-source projects for inspiration.

The guide should reflect our "Documentation as First-Class Citizen" tenet and emphasize documentation-first development.
