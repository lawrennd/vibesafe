# Task: Improved Installation Script

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_improved-installation-script
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Completed**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: Neil Lawrence

## Description

The installation script needed significant improvements to make it more robust, testable, and maintainable. The original implementation had several issues that made testing difficult and inefficient.

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Environment variable configuration** - Added support for configuring the script via environment variables:
   - `VIBESAFE_REPO_URL` - URL of the VibeSafe repository
   - `VIBESAFE_SKIP_CLONE` - Skip cloning the repository
   - `VIBESAFE_TEMPLATES_DIR` - Use a custom templates directory
   - `VIBESAFE_DEBUG` - Enable debug output

2. **Self-documenting templates** - Modified the script to copy templates directly from the repository structure instead of hard-coding them in the script:
   - Allows templates to be maintained in a single place
   - Preserves custom directory structures in templates
   - Makes the template system extensible

3. **Improved testing** - Created robust tests that verify:
   - Basic installation functionality
   - Custom template directory handling
   - Preservation of existing files
   - Error handling for missing dependencies
   - Debug output mode

4. **Better error handling** - Improved error handling and reporting:
   - Graceful fallback to defaults when repository is unavailable
   - Better debugging information when templates are missing
   - Proper exit codes for different failure scenarios

5. **Directory structure preservation** - Enhanced the template copying logic to properly preserve nested directory structures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Script is configurable via environment variables
- [x] Templates are copied from the repository instead of hard-coded
- [x] Custom template directory structures are preserved
- [x] All tests pass reliably without hanging
- [x] Debug output is available when needed

## Implementation Notes

The key change was moving from a model where the directory structure was hard-coded in the script to one where the structure is defined by the templates themselves. This makes the system much more maintainable and reduces duplication.

The main functions affected were:
- `copy_templates_from_repo()` - Completely rewritten to properly handle nested directories
- `install_vibesafe()` - Enhanced to support environment variable configuration
- Added `debug()` function for improved debugging
