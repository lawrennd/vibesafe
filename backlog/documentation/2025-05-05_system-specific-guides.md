## Description

Develop comprehensive documentation for each of VibeSafe's core systems (CIP, Backlog, Tenets). Currently, while we have README files that provide basic overviews, we lack detailed guides that walk users through each system from start to finish with practical examples and best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a dedicated guide for the CIP system, including:
  - Detailed process flow from creation to completion
  - Examples of well-written CIPs
  - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
  - Integration with other systems

- [ ] Create a dedicated guide for the Backlog system, including:
  - Task creation and management process
  - Prioritization strategies
  - Examples of effective tasks
  - Progress tracking best practices

- [ ] Create a dedicated guide for the Tenet system, including:
  - Process for defining and refining tenets
  - How to apply tenets in decision-making
  - Examples of well-crafted tenets
  - Strategies for evolving tenets over time

- [ ] Ensure all guides include:
  - Step-by-step tutorials
  - Common workflows and patterns
  - Visual aids (diagrams, screenshots)
  - FAQ sections

## Implementation Notes

Each guide should follow the documentation style guide standards and exemplify our documentation-first approach. Guides should be accessible to newcomers while also providing depth for experienced users.

Consider organizing guides with a progressive disclosure approach: quick start, common usage, advanced topics, and reference material.
