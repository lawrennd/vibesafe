- **ID**: 2025-05-05_breadcrumbs-pattern-tenet
- **Title**: Evaluate Elevating "Breadcrumbs Pattern" to a Formal Tenet
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05

- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0008

## Description

The "Breadcrumbs Pattern" has emerged organically as a key practice in VibeSafe, involving the explicit documentation of thought processes and decision trails through CIPs, tenets, and documentation. This task involves evaluating whether this pattern should be elevated to a formal tenet, providing it with the same prominence and visibility as our other core principles.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Analyze the extent to which the Breadcrumbs Pattern is already reflected in our existing tenets
- [ ] Evaluate the uniqueness and importance of the pattern as a guiding principle
- [ ] Draft a potential tenet document for the Breadcrumbs Pattern including:
  - Clear description
  - Memorable quote
  - Practical examples and counter-examples
  - Potential conflicts with other tenets and resolution strategies
- [ ] Gather feedback from community members on the potential tenet
- [ ] Make a recommendation on whether to:
  - Elevate the pattern to a formal tenet
  - Keep it as a documented pattern only
  - Incorporate aspects into existing tenets

## Implementation Notes

This task should be approached after the completion of the CIP-0008 implementation, so we can see how the pattern is documented and referenced in the unified philosophy document. The evaluation should consider:

1. How fundamental is the Breadcrumbs Pattern to VibeSafe's approach?
2. Does it provide unique guidance not covered by existing tenets?
3. Would elevating it to a tenet help guide development decisions?
4. How does it relate to the proposed new tenets in CIP-0008?

If the decision is to create a new tenet, this would likely require a new CIP to formalize that change.
