# Integrating Requirements with Backlog Tasks

This guide explains how to connect the AI-Assisted Requirements Framework with VibeSafe's Backlog System, providing traceability from user requirements to implementation tasks.

## Overview

The Requirements Framework and Backlog System complement each other:

- *Requirements Framework*: Focuses on gathering, refining, and validating user needs
- *Backlog System*: Focuses on tracking and managing implementation tasks

By connecting these systems, you create traceability from high-level requirements to specific implementation tasks, ensuring that development work directly addresses user needs and nothing falls through the cracks.

## Integration Process

### 1. From Requirements to Backlog Tasks

When requirements are ready to be implemented:

1. Break down requirements into discrete, actionable tasks
2. Create backlog items for each task with appropriate metadata
3. Reference the source requirements in each backlog item
4. Update the requirements document with links to associated tasks
5. Apply consistent prioritization and estimation

#### Example Backlog Task Template Addition

```markdown
## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements:
- [Link to requirements document 1]
- [Link to requirements document 2]

Specifically, it addresses:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]
```

### 2. From Backlog Tasks to Requirements

When tasks lead to new or revised requirements:

1. Document the new requirements using the requirements framework
2. Link back to the originating backlog items
3. Validate the requirements with stakeholders
4. Update affected backlog items to reference the new requirements

### 3. Implementation Status Tracking

Use both systems to track implementation status:

1. Backlog task status (Proposed, Ready, In Progress, Completed, Abandoned) tracks implementation progress
2. Requirements document maintains an "Implementation Status" section showing overall progress
3. Cross-reference between the two to maintain alignment

#### Example Requirements Status Addition

```markdown
## Implementation Status

The requirements in this document are being addressed through the following backlog tasks:

| Requirement | Implementation Status | Backlog Task Reference |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| User Profile Management | In Progress | [Task 2025-05-01_user-profiles](../../backlog/features/2025-05-01_user-profiles.md) |
| Email Notifications | Ready | [Task 2025-05-02_email-notifications](../../backlog/features/2025-05-02_email-notifications.md) |
| Data Export | Completed | [Task 2025-04-15_data-export](../../backlog/features/2025-04-15_data-export.md) |
```

## Prioritization and Estimation

Unlike CIPs, backlog tasks require specific guidance on prioritization and estimation:

### Prioritization Guidelines

Derive task priority from requirements using these factors:
1. **Business value**: How important is this to stakeholders?
2. **Dependency order**: What must be completed first?
3. **Risk mitigation**: Does this address critical risks?
4. **Technical foundation**: Does this enable other work?

Document the reasoning for priority decisions in both the requirements and the backlog item.

### Estimation Guidelines

Estimate effort based on:
1. **Task complexity**: How technically complicated is the implementation?
2. **Scope clarity**: How well-defined is the requirement?
3. **Team familiarity**: How familiar is the team with this type of work?
4. **Integration points**: How many system components does this affect?

Use relative estimation (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) or story points if your team uses them.

## Maintaining Requirements-Backlog Alignment

To ensure ongoing alignment:

1. *Requirements Update Process*:
   - When requirements change, identify affected backlog items
   - Update or create backlog items as needed
   - Document the rationale for changes

2. *Backlog Update Process*:
   - When implementation approaches change, assess impact on requirements
   - Update requirements if changes affect user-visible behavior
   - Get stakeholder sign-off on significant changes

3. *Integration Review*:
   - Periodically review the alignment between requirements and backlog items
   - Address any disconnects or misalignments
   - Update cross-references to maintain traceability

## Tools for Requirements-Backlog Integration

### 1. Bi-directional Linking

Maintain explicit links between requirements and backlog items in both directions:
- Requirements documents link to relevant backlog items
- Backlog items link back to source requirements

### 2. Traceability Matrix

Create a traceability matrix to visualize the relationships:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Backlog Item | Status | Priority | Effort |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| REQ-001 | User login via OAuth | 2025-05-01_user-auth | In Progress | High | Medium |
| REQ-002 | Data export to CSV | 2025-05-02_data-export | Ready | Medium | Small |
| REQ-003 | Weekly report generation | 2025-04-15_reports | Completed | High | Large |

### 3. Status Synchronization

Develop a consistent approach to status updates:
- Define how status changes in backlog items affect requirements status
- Establish who is responsible for maintaining alignment
- Create a schedule for alignment checks

## Example Integration Workflow

1. *Requirements Discovery*:
   - Conduct requirements conversations with stakeholders
   - Document requirements using the framework
   - Validate requirements with stakeholders

2. *Backlog Creation*:
   - Break down requirements into specific tasks
   - Create backlog items with explicit requirements references
   - Apply consistent prioritization and estimation
   - Update requirements with backlog item references

3. *Implementation*:
   - Implement backlog items according to their priority
   - Update both backlog and requirements status as progress occurs
   - Address any requirement changes through formal updates

4. *Validation and Closure*:
   - Validate implementation against original requirements
   - Update both requirements and backlog status to "Completed"
   - Document any deviations or future enhancements

## Best Practices

1. *Right-Size Tasks*: Break requirements into tasks that can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
2. *Be Explicit About Dependencies*: Clearly document how tasks depend on each other
3. *Balance Detail*: Requirements focus on "what" and "why", backlog items on "how" and "when"
4. *Keep Both Systems Updated*: When status changes in one system, update the other
5. *Include Acceptance Criteria*: Derived from requirements in every backlog item

## Template for Requirement-Derived Backlog Items

When creating backlog items from requirements, use this template addition:

```markdown
## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements:
- [Link to requirements document]

Specifically, it addresses:
- [Specific requirement text]

## Acceptance Criteria

Based on the source requirements, this task will be considered complete when:
1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]

## Estimation Rationale

This task is estimated as [Small/Medium/Large] effort because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]

## Prioritization Rationale

This task is [High/Medium/Low] priority because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]
