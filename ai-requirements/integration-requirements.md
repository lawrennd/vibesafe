# Requirement: VibeSafe Component Integration

## Description

VibeSafe components (CIPs, backlog, tenets, requirements) need to work together seamlessly through well-defined integration points. The system should maintain traceability between requirements, implementation plans (CIPs), and tasks (backlog items), while ensuring alignment with project principles (tenets). This integration should be lightweight yet complete, allowing users to navigate easily between related artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Consistent references between requirements and CIPs
- [ ] Traceability from backlog items to requirements and CIPs
- [ ] Standardized status synchronization between components
- [ ] Cross-linking in templates (e.g., Related Requirements section in CIP template)
- [ ] Documentation of integration workflows
- [ ] Visualization capability for relationships between components
- [ ] Unified metadata handling across all component types
- [ ] What's Next script that shows integrated status across components

## User Stories

As a developer, I want to see which requirements a CIP addresses so that I understand the purpose of the implementation.

As a product manager, I want to trace from requirements to actual implementation tasks so that I can verify all requirements are being addressed.

As a project manager, I want synchronized status tracking across components so that I can get an accurate picture of overall progress.

As a team member, I want to navigate easily between related artifacts (from requirement to CIP to backlog items) so that I can understand the full context of a feature.

## Constraints

- Integration should not depend on specific file locations or project structures
- References must be resilient to file renaming and reorganization
- Performance should scale well with hundreds of artifacts
- Integration mechanisms should work with or without AI assistance

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using relative links for cross-references
- Implement consistent ID schemas across all component types
- Use YAML frontmatter for relationship metadata
- Create visualization scripts or tools for relationship mapping
- Define clear status equivalence between different component types
- Ensure integration points are explicitly documented in templates

- CIP: TBD (To be created for implementing integration mechanisms)
- Backlog Items: TBD (To be created for integration tasks)
- Other Requirements: REQ-001 (VibeSafe Core Functionality), REQ-002 (AI-Assisted Requirements Framework)

## Implementation Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Implemented
- [ ] Validated
