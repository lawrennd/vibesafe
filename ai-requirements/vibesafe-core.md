# Requirement: VibeSafe Core Functionality

## Description

VibeSafe needs to provide a comprehensive framework for safe AI development that integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows. The system should support a structured process for proposing, documenting, and implementing code improvements (CIPs), tracking tasks (backlog), defining project tenets, and capturing requirements. The core functionality should be modular, extensible, and accessible to developers of varying experience levels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Support for Code Improvement Plans (CIPs) with consistent formatting and status tracking
- [ ] Backlog management system for tracking tasks, bugs, and features
- [ ] Project tenets definition and documentation capabilities
- [ ] AI-assisted requirements framework for natural language requirements specification
- [ ] What's Next functionality to provide contextual guidance on project status and next steps
- [ ] Integration between all components (CIPs, backlog, tenets, requirements)
- [ ] Documentation that guides users through the VibeSafe workflow

## User Stories

As a developer, I want to propose and track code improvements with clear status and implementation plans so that I can coordinate complex changes across the codebase.

As a project manager, I want to understand the current status of ongoing work and what should be done next so that I can prioritize tasks effectively.

As a team member, I want to quickly understand the project's guiding principles so that my work aligns with the team's values and goals.

As a non-technical stakeholder, I want to articulate requirements in natural language that can be linked to technical implementation so that my needs are correctly addressed in the final product.

## Constraints

- Development must be compatible with existing version control workflows
- Tools must require minimal setup and dependencies
- Framework should balance structure with flexibility to accommodate different project types
- All components should function with or without AI assistance

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using YAML frontmatter consistently across all document types for metadata
- Ensure tools degrade gracefully when optional components are not available
- Scripts should be cross-platform compatible where possible
- Document templates should include clear instructions for use
