# Requirement: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework

## Description

The AI-Assisted Requirements Framework should bridge the gap between natural language requirements and technical implementation. It should provide tools, templates, patterns, and prompts that help users articulate, refine, validate, and track requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. The framework should integrate with other VibeSafe components (CIPs, backlog) to ensure requirements are linked to implementation tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Requirements template with YAML frontmatter for consistent metadata
- [ ] Directory structure for organizing requirements artifacts
- [ ] Prompts for requirements discovery, refinement, validation, and testing
- [ ] Patterns for common requirements scenarios (e.g., goal decomposition, stakeholder identification)
- [ ] Integration mechanisms for connecting requirements to CIPs and backlog items
- [ ] Status tracking for requirements that aligns with implementation status
- [ ] Guidance for using AI assistants in the requirements process
- [ ] Example requirements documents that demonstrate the framework's application

## User Stories

As a product manager, I want to use familiar natural language to describe what needs to be built so that I don't have to learn technical specifications.

As a developer, I want requirements to be clearly structured and traceable to implementation tasks so that I can verify I'm building the right thing.

As a project stakeholder, I want to validate that the implemented system meets my original requirements so that I can be confident in the solution.

As an AI assistant, I want clear patterns and prompts for requirements conversations so that I can provide more valuable guidance.

## Constraints

- Must work with or without AI assistance
- Should not require specialized requirements engineering knowledge
- Must support evolution of requirements over time
- Should be lightweight enough to use in small projects but scalable to larger ones

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using conversation patterns from requirements engineering literature
- Define clear status workflows that connect to implementation status
- Create a traceability matrix approach for linking requirements to other artifacts
- Use YAML frontmatter for all metadata to ensure consistency with other VibeSafe components
