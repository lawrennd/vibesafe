# VibeSafe Tenets

This file demonstrates the tenet format using VibeSafe's own tenets as an example. Projects using the VibeSafe tenet system can define their own tenets following this format.

## Tenet: user-autonomy

**Title**: User Autonomy Over Prescription

**Description**: We provide tools and frameworks that respect users' freedom to make their own architectural and implementation choices. We avoid making decisions that restrict users unnecessarily. When designing solutions, we build flexibility in from the start rather than imposing our preferred approach.

**Quote**: *"We optimize for configurability over our own preferences."*

**Examples**:
- The gist integration system (CIP-0003) provides multiple implementation options and a flexible architecture
- The installation system offers both minimal shell scripts and more feature-rich Python implementations
- Configuration files allow customization of default behaviors

**Counter-examples**:
- Forcing users to adopt a rigid directory structure with no configuration options
- Hardcoding assumptions about development environments
- Requiring specific tools or platforms without alternatives

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "Simplicity at the Point of Use" when too many options create complexity
- Resolution: Provide sensible defaults while allowing configuration

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: simplicity-of-use

**Title**: Simplicity at the Point of Use

**Description**: While implementations may be complex behind the scenes, the user experience should be simple and intuitive. We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or showing off technical prowess.

**Quote**: *"Complicated to build is acceptable; complicated to use is not."*

**Examples**:
- One-line installation scripts that handle different environments automatically
- Templates that provide clear starting points for new users
- Consistent naming and behavior patterns across different features

**Counter-examples**:
- Requiring users to understand internal implementation details
- Exposing configuration options for everything without good defaults
- Prioritizing implementation elegance over usability

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when simplification limits flexibility
- Resolution: Layer complexity - simple for basic use, configurable for advanced use

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: documentation-first

**Title**: Documentation as First-Class Citizen

**Description**: Documentation is not an afterthought but a core part of any feature or tool. We write documentation first, then implement to match the documented behavior. This approach ensures that our interfaces are understandable and user-focused.

**Quote**: *"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."*

**Examples**:
- CIPs document proposed changes before implementation
- READMEs explain concepts before diving into code
- Example-driven documentation shows practical usage

**Counter-examples**:
- Adding features without updating documentation
- Documentation that doesn't match actual behavior
- Technical descriptions without practical examples

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with rapid iteration when documentation becomes outdated
- Resolution: Treat documentation updates as part of the implementation, not separate

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: purposeful-standardization

**Title**: Standardization with Purpose

**Description**: We standardize processes and practices where consistency provides clear value to users. However, we avoid standardization for its own sake or when it would restrict innovation or adaptability to different contexts.

**Quote**: *"We standardize to empower, not to control."*

**Examples**:
- Consistent file naming conventions that aid discoverability
- Standard templates that reduce setup time
- Common interfaces across different components

**Counter-examples**:
- Enforcing standards that don't provide clear benefits
- One-size-fits-all approaches that ignore context differences
- Standards that prevent innovation or experimentation

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when standards limit flexibility
- Resolution: Make standards optional when they don't provide universal benefit

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: dogfooding

**Title**: Dogfooding as Validation

**Description**: We use our own tools and practices in the development of VibeSafe itself. This ensures that we experience the same benefits and challenges as our users, leading to more practical and tested solutions.

**Quote**: *"We build what we would want to use ourselves."*

**Examples**:
- VibeSafe uses its own CIP system for planning changes
- The backlog system tracks VibeSafe's own tasks
- Our tenets system documents VibeSafe's own principles

**Counter-examples**:
- Recommending practices we don't follow ourselves
- Creating tools we wouldn't want to use
- Ignoring usability issues we encounter

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" if our preferences unduly influence design
- Resolution: Use dogfooding for validation, not as the sole design input

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: composability

**Title**: Composable Over Monolithic

**Description**: We design components that can be used independently or together, allowing users to adopt only what they need. We prefer small, focused tools with clear interfaces over large, all-encompassing solutions.

**Quote**: *"Small pieces, loosely joined."*

**Examples**:
- Backlog system can be used without CIPs
- Components can be installed selectively
- Tools can be adopted incrementally

**Counter-examples**:
- Features that require adopting the entire VibeSafe ecosystem
- Tight coupling between components
- All-or-nothing adoption models

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "Simplicity of Use" when flexibility creates complexity
- Resolution: Design for composability but provide integrations for convenience

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)

## Tenet: evolution

**Title**: Evolution Over Revolution

**Description**: We design for incremental improvement rather than disruptive change. New features and tools should integrate with existing workflows and provide clear migration paths from existing practices.

**Quote**: *"Respect the past while building for the future."*

**Examples**:
- Backward compatibility in new versions
- Clear migration paths when breaking changes are necessary
- Support for gradual adoption of new features

**Counter-examples**:
- Frequent breaking changes without migration paths
- Requiring complete workflow changes to adopt new features
- Deprecating functionality without alternatives

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with innovation when backward compatibility limits improvements
- Resolution: Provide compatibility layers and clear migration guidance

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)
