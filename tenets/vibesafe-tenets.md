# Vibesafe Tenets

This document combines all individual tenet files from the project.

## Tenet: documentation-as-code

**Title**: Documentation and Implementation as a Unified Whole

**Description**: Documentation and implementation should be treated as a unified, interdependent system rather than separate concerns. Documentation guides implementation by establishing clear goals and expectations, while implementation embodies and validates that documentation through self-documenting design. This bidirectional relationship ensures that our systems remain understandable, accurate, and maintainable.

**Quote**: *"Document to guide implementation; implement to validate documentation."*

**Examples**:
- Writing CIPs that define expected behaviors, then implementing systems that inherently demonstrate those behaviors
- API documentation that defines interfaces, paired with code that uses clear naming and structure matching the documentation
- Directory structures that follow the same organization described in documentation
- Configuration options with names that directly reflect their documented purpose
- Environment variables that document their purpose through their naming
- Tests that serve as working examples of documented behaviors

**Counter-examples**:
- Documentation that describes one behavior while code implements another
- Hard-coded magic values that require separate explanation
- Systems that can only be understood by reading extensive external documentation
- Adding features without updating both implementation and documentation
- Implementation that requires documentation to be understandable

**Practices**:
- Begin with documentation to establish design intent
- Structure implementation to mirror and embody that documentation
- When changing code, update documentation simultaneously
- When changing documentation, ensure implementation reflects the changes
- Use self-explanatory names, structures, and organization in code
- Test against documented behaviors rather than implementation details

**Conflicts**:
- May appear to slow initial development by requiring both clear documentation and self-documenting code
- Resolution: The investment pays off through reduced maintenance burden and fewer misunderstandings

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: information-exploration-patterns

**Title**: Information Exploration Patterns

**Description**: VibeSafe supports different patterns of information exploration, from detailed focus on specific improvements to broader conceptual navigation. This approach parallels how humans naturally navigate information spaces, allowing both fine-grained understanding and big-picture perspective.

**Quote**: *"Navigate from detail to context and back again."*

**Examples**:
- Backlog items that focus on specific improvements while linking to broader goals
- CIPs that provide both detailed implementation plans and high-level motivation
- Documentation that offers both quick-start guides and comprehensive references
- Tenets that help connect specific decisions to general principles

**Counter-examples**:
- Documentation that only provides low-level details without context
- Isolated improvements with no connection to broader goals
- Rigid structures that don't support different exploration approaches
- Requiring linear reading without supporting different information needs

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with simplicity when supporting multiple exploration patterns adds complexity
- Resolution: Design core paths for common exploration patterns while enabling less common patterns without cluttering the primary experience

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: shared-information-landmarks

**Title**: Shared Information Landmarks

**Description**: VibeSafe creates explicit "information landmarks" in code and documentation that serve as fixed reference points for both humans and AI systems. These landmarks provide a shared conceptual framework that grounds understanding and enables reliable exploration of complex information spaces.

**Quote**: *"Reliable collaboration requires shared reference points."*

**Examples**:
- CIPs that explicitly outline reasoning behind changes
- Tenets that define clear guiding principles
- Directory structures that organize information in intuitive ways
- Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions

**Counter-examples**:
- Implicit design decisions with no documented rationale
- Code organization that requires insider knowledge to navigate
- Inconsistent terminology across different parts of a system
- Documentation that doesn't reflect the actual structure

**Conflicts**:
- May conflict with rapid iteration when maintaining landmarks requires additional effort
- Resolution: Design landmark patterns that minimize maintenance overhead

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: simplicity-of-use

**Title**: Simplicity at All Levels

**Description**: We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or technical prowess. VibeSafe should be lightweight in implementation, with minimal dependencies that are commonly available. We favor simplicity both in user experience and in implementation.

**Quote**: *"Simplicity matters everywhere - in usage, code, and dependencies."*

**Examples**:
- One-line installation scripts that handle different environments automatically
- Templates that provide clear starting points for new users
- Consistent naming and behavior patterns across different features
- Minimal dependencies that are standard across platforms
- Core functionality with well-defined extension points for others to build upon
- Clean, maintainable codebase that avoids unnecessary complexity

**Counter-examples**:
- Requiring users to understand internal implementation details
- Exposing configuration options for everything without good defaults
- Prioritizing implementation elegance over usability
- Adding dependencies that are rarely available or difficult to install
- Feature bloat that makes the system harder to maintain and understand
- Overly complex implementation that's difficult to maintain or extend

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when simplification limits flexibility
- Resolution: Layer complexity - simple for basic use, configurable for advanced use

**Version**: 1.2 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: user-autonomy

**Title**: User Autonomy Over Prescription

**Description**: We provide tools and frameworks that respect users' freedom to make their own architectural and implementation choices. We avoid making decisions that restrict users unnecessarily. When designing solutions, we build flexibility in from the start rather than imposing our preferred approach.

**Quote**: *"We optimize for configurability over our own preferences."*

**Examples**:
- The gist integration system (CIP-0003) provides multiple implementation options and a flexible architecture
- The installation system offers both minimal shell scripts and more feature-rich Python implementations
- Configuration files allow customization of default behaviors

**Counter-examples**:
- Forcing users to adopt a rigid directory structure with no configuration options
- Hardcoding assumptions about development environments
- Requiring specific tools or platforms without alternatives

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "Simplicity at the Point of Use" when too many options create complexity
- Resolution: Provide sensible defaults while allowing configuration

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)
