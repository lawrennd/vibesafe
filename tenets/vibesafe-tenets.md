# Vibesafe Tenets

*Generated on 2025-05-05*

This document combines all individual tenet files from the project.

## Tenet: documentation-first

**Title**: Documentation as First-Class Citizen

**Description**: Documentation is not an afterthought but a core part of any feature or tool. We write documentation first, then implement to match the documented behavior. This approach ensures that our interfaces are understandable and user-focused.

**Quote**: *"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."*

**Examples**:
- CIPs document proposed changes before implementation
- READMEs explain concepts before diving into code
- Example-driven documentation shows practical usage

**Counter-examples**:
- Adding features without updating documentation
- Documentation that doesn't match actual behavior
- Technical descriptions without practical examples

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with rapid iteration when documentation becomes outdated
- Resolution: Treat documentation updates as part of the implementation, not separate

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: simplicity-of-use

**Title**: Simplicity at the Point of Use

**Description**: While implementations may be complex behind the scenes, the user experience should be simple and intuitive. We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or showing off technical prowess.

**Quote**: *"Complicated to build is acceptable; complicated to use is not."*

**Examples**:
- One-line installation scripts that handle different environments automatically
- Templates that provide clear starting points for new users
- Consistent naming and behavior patterns across different features

**Counter-examples**:
- Requiring users to understand internal implementation details
- Exposing configuration options for everything without good defaults
- Prioritizing implementation elegance over usability

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when simplification limits flexibility
- Resolution: Layer complexity - simple for basic use, configurable for advanced use

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05) 

## Tenet: user-autonomy

**Title**: User Autonomy Over Prescription

**Description**: We provide tools and frameworks that respect users' freedom to make their own architectural and implementation choices. We avoid making decisions that restrict users unnecessarily. When designing solutions, we build flexibility in from the start rather than imposing our preferred approach.

**Quote**: *"We optimize for configurability over our own preferences."*

**Examples**:
- The gist integration system (CIP-0003) provides multiple implementation options and a flexible architecture
- The installation system offers both minimal shell scripts and more feature-rich Python implementations
- Configuration files allow customization of default behaviors

**Counter-examples**:
- Forcing users to adopt a rigid directory structure with no configuration options
- Hardcoding assumptions about development environments
- Requiring specific tools or platforms without alternatives

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "Simplicity at the Point of Use" when too many options create complexity
- Resolution: Provide sensible defaults while allowing configuration

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)
