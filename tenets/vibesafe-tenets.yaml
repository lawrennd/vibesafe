      - Documentation and Implementation as a Unified Whole
    - - description
      - Documentation and implementation should be treated as a unified, interdependent
        system rather than separate concerns. Documentation guides implementation
        by establishing clear goals and expectations, while implementation embodies
        and validates that documentation through self-documenting design. This bidirectional
        relationship ensures that our systems remain understandable, accurate, and
        maintainable.

      - Information Exploration Patterns
    - - description
      - VibeSafe supports different patterns of information exploration, from detailed
        focus on specific improvements to broader conceptual navigation. This approach
        parallels how humans naturally navigate information spaces, allowing both
        fine-grained understanding and big-picture perspective.

      - Shared Information Landmarks
    - - description
      - VibeSafe creates explicit "information landmarks" in code and documentation
        that serve as fixed reference points for both humans and AI systems. These
        landmarks provide a shared conceptual framework that grounds understanding
        and enables reliable exploration of complex information spaces.

      - Simplicity at All Levels
    - - description
      - We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or
        technical prowess. VibeSafe should be lightweight in implementation, with
        minimal dependencies that are commonly available. We favor simplicity both
        in user experience and in implementation.
    - - quote
      - Simplicity matters everywhere - in usage, code, and dependencies.

      - User Autonomy Over Prescription
    - - description
      - We provide tools and frameworks that respect users' freedom to make their
        own architectural and implementation choices. We avoid making decisions that
        restrict users unnecessarily. When designing solutions, we build flexibility
        in from the start rather than imposing our preferred approach.
    - - quote
      - We optimize for configurability over our own preferences.
