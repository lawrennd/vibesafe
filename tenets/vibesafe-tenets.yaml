      - Documentation as First-Class Citizen
    - - description
      - Documentation is not an afterthought but a core part of any feature or tool.
        We write documentation first, then implement to match the documented behavior.
        This approach ensures that our interfaces are understandable and user-focused.

      - Simplicity at All Levels
    - - description
      - We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or
        technical prowess. VibeSafe should be lightweight in implementation, with
        minimal dependencies that are commonly available. We favor simplicity both
        in user experience and in implementation.
    - - quote
      - Simplicity matters everywhere - in usage, code, and dependencies.

      - User Autonomy Over Prescription
    - - description
      - We provide tools and frameworks that respect users' freedom to make their
        own architectural and implementation choices. We avoid making decisions that
        restrict users unnecessarily. When designing solutions, we build flexibility
        in from the start rather than imposing our preferred approach.
    - - quote
      - We optimize for configurability over our own preferences.
