## Tenet: documentation-first

**Title**: Documentation as First-Class Citizen

**Description**: Documentation is not an afterthought but a core part of any feature or tool. We write documentation first, then implement to match the documented behavior. This approach ensures that our interfaces are understandable and user-focused.

**Quote**: *"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."*

**Examples**:
- CIPs document proposed changes before implementation
- READMEs explain concepts before diving into code
- Example-driven documentation shows practical usage

**Counter-examples**:
- Adding features without updating documentation
- Documentation that doesn't match actual behavior
- Technical descriptions without practical examples

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with rapid iteration when documentation becomes outdated
- Resolution: Treat documentation updates as part of the implementation, not separate

**Version**: 1.0 (2025-05-05)
