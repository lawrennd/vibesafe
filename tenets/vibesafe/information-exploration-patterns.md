## Tenet: information-exploration-patterns

**Title**: Information Exploration Patterns

**Description**: VibeSafe supports different patterns of information exploration, from detailed focus on specific improvements to broader conceptual navigation. This approach parallels how humans naturally navigate information spaces, allowing both fine-grained understanding and big-picture perspective.

**Quote**: *"Navigate from detail to context and back again."*

**Examples**:
- Backlog items that focus on specific improvements while linking to broader goals
- CIPs that provide both detailed implementation plans and high-level motivation
- Documentation that offers both quick-start guides and comprehensive references
- Tenets that help connect specific decisions to general principles

**Counter-examples**:
- Documentation that only provides low-level details without context
- Isolated improvements with no connection to broader goals
- Rigid structures that don't support different exploration approaches
- Requiring linear reading without supporting different information needs

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with simplicity when supporting multiple exploration patterns adds complexity
- Resolution: Design core paths for common exploration patterns while enabling less common patterns without cluttering the primary experience
