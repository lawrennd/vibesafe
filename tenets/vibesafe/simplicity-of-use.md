## Tenet: simplicity-of-use

**Title**: Simplicity at the Point of Use

**Description**: While implementations may be complex behind the scenes, the user experience should be simple and intuitive. We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or showing off technical prowess.

**Quote**: *"Complicated to build is acceptable; complicated to use is not."*

**Examples**:
- One-line installation scripts that handle different environments automatically
- Templates that provide clear starting points for new users
- Consistent naming and behavior patterns across different features

**Counter-examples**:
- Requiring users to understand internal implementation details
- Exposing configuration options for everything without good defaults
- Prioritizing implementation elegance over usability

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when simplification limits flexibility
- Resolution: Layer complexity - simple for basic use, configurable for advanced use
