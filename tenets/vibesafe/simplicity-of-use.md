## Tenet: simplicity-of-use

**Title**: Simplicity at All Levels

**Description**: We prioritize ease of adoption and daily use over theoretical elegance or technical prowess. VibeSafe should be lightweight in implementation, with minimal dependencies that are commonly available. We favor simplicity both in user experience and in implementation.

**Quote**: *"Simplicity matters everywhere - in usage, code, and dependencies."*

**Examples**:
- One-line installation scripts that handle different environments automatically
- Templates that provide clear starting points for new users
- Consistent naming and behavior patterns across different features
- Minimal dependencies that are standard across platforms
- Core functionality with well-defined extension points for others to build upon
- Clean, maintainable codebase that avoids unnecessary complexity

**Counter-examples**:
- Requiring users to understand internal implementation details
- Exposing configuration options for everything without good defaults
- Prioritizing implementation elegance over usability
- Adding dependencies that are rarely available or difficult to install
- Feature bloat that makes the system harder to maintain and understand
- Overly complex implementation that's difficult to maintain or extend

**Conflicts**:
- Can conflict with "User Autonomy" when simplification limits flexibility
- Resolution: Layer complexity - simple for basic use, configurable for advanced use
