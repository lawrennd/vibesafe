## Tenet: shared-information-landmarks

**Title**: Shared Information Landmarks

**Description**: VibeSafe creates explicit "information landmarks" in code and documentation that serve as fixed reference points for both humans and AI systems. These landmarks provide a shared conceptual framework that grounds understanding and enables reliable exploration of complex information spaces.

**Quote**: *"Reliable collaboration requires shared reference points."*

**Examples**:
- CIPs that explicitly outline reasoning behind changes
- Tenets that define clear guiding principles
- Directory structures that organize information in intuitive ways
- Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions

**Counter-examples**:
- Implicit design decisions with no documented rationale
- Code organization that requires insider knowledge to navigate
- Inconsistent terminology across different parts of a system
- Documentation that doesn't reflect the actual structure

**Conflicts**:
- May conflict with rapid iteration when maintaining landmarks requires additional effort
- Resolution: Design landmark patterns that minimize maintenance overhead
