# VibeSafe Update Guide

## Update VibeSafe

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrennd/vibesafe/main/scripts/install-minimal.sh)
```

**Clean Installation Philosophy**: Every installation is a reinstallation. System files are updated, user content is preserved.

## For AI Assistants

- Never manually edit VibeSafe system files (they're overwritten on update)
- Always use the installation script to update
- Preserve user content (backlog tasks, CIPs, tenets, README, code)
