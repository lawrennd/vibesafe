# VibeSafe Project Status Summarizer ("What's Next" Script)

## What is the "What's Next" Script?

The "What's Next" script is a project status summarizer that helps LLMs and human users quickly understand the current state of the VibeSafe project and identify pending tasks.

## When to Use the "What's Next" Script

Use the "What's Next" script when:

- You are beginning work on the VibeSafe project and need context
- You want to understand the current project priorities
- You need to identify which files need YAML frontmatter
- You are looking for high-priority tasks to work on
- You need to see the Git status, CIPs, and backlog in one view

## How to Run the Script

After installation (using `./install-whats-next.sh`), run the script from the root directory of the VibeSafe repository:

```bash
./whats-next
```

If you prefer to run it directly, make sure to activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/whats_next.py
deactivate  # When finished
```

### Command Line Options

The script supports several command line options:

- `--no-git`: Skip Git status information
- `--no-color`: Disable colored output
- `--cip-only`: Only show CIP information
- `--backlog-only`: Only show backlog information
- `--quiet`: Suppress all output except next steps

Examples:

```bash
# Show only the next steps (useful for quick reference)
./whats-next --quiet

# Focus only on CIPs
./whats-next --cip-only
```

## What the Script Provides

The script provides a comprehensive overview of:

1. **Git Status**: Current branch, recent commits, modified files, untracked files
2. **CIP Status**: All CIPs categorized by status (proposed, accepted, implemented, closed)
3. **Backlog Status**: Backlog items with priority and status information
4. **Recommended Next Steps**: Prioritized actions based on the project's current state
5. **Files Needing YAML Frontmatter**: Specific files missing required metadata

## For LLMs: How to Use This Information

As an LLM working on the VibeSafe project, you should:

1. Run the "What's Next" script at the beginning of your session
2. Review the recommended next steps section for guidance on priorities
3. Pay attention to any files needing YAML frontmatter
4. Focus on high-priority backlog items and accepted CIPs
5. Check the current branch before making changes

This approach ensures you have the necessary context to make informed decisions about what to work on and how to prioritize tasks.

## Installation

The "What's Next" script requires Python 3.6+ and the PyYAML library. It uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

To install:

```bash
# This creates a virtual environment and sets up a convenient wrapper
./install-whats-next.sh
```

## YAML Frontmatter

The script checks for YAML frontmatter in CIPs and backlog items. All such files should have proper frontmatter with required metadata fields. For examples, see the [YAML Frontmatter Examples](mdc:../docs/yaml_frontmatter_examples.md) document.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on the "What's Next" script, see [docs/whats_next_script.md](mdc:../docs/whats_next_script.md).
