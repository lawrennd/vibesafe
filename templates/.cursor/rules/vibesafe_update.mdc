# VibeSafe Update Guide

## How to Update VibeSafe

Update VibeSafe by running the installation script from your project root:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrennd/vibesafe/main/scripts/install-minimal.sh)
```

VibeSafe follows the **Clean Installation Philosophy** - every installation is also a reinstallation.

## What Happens

**✅ System Files Updated:**
- Templates, cursor rules, scripts, system documentation

**🛡️ Your Content Preserved:**
- Your backlog tasks, CIPs, tenets, README, code, and configuration

## For AI Assistants

- **Never manually edit VibeSafe system files** - they're overwritten on update
- **Always use the installation script** to update
- **Preserve user content** - never delete backlog tasks, CIPs, or user tenets
