# CIP-0015: Human Authorship Enforcement and Governance-Drift Guardrails

## Status

- [ ] Proposed - Initial idea documented
- [ ] Accepted - Approved, ready to start work
- [ ] In Progress - Actively being implemented
- [ ] Implemented - Work complete, awaiting verification
- [x] Closed - Verified and complete
- [ ] Rejected - Will not be implemented (add reason, use superseded_by if replaced)
- [ ] Deferred - Postponed (use blocked_by field to indicate blocker)

## Summary

This CIP documents (retroactively) the enforcement of **human authorship and single-threaded accountability** in VibeSafe metadata, and adds guardrails to detect “governance drift” (implementation/tooling changes without corresponding planning artifacts).

This work implements:
- **REQ-0010** (human authorship attribution and single-threaded ownership)
- **REQ-0006** (process conformance validation)
- **REQ-0001** (standardized metadata)

## Motivation

We introduced significant governance behaviour (enforced responsibility metadata and exception paths) without first creating a CIP. That is an “own goal” against VibeSafe’s purpose: making intent, accountability, and traceability explicit.

This retrospective CIP restores traceability by documenting:
- what policy was implemented,
- why it was implemented,
- where the enforcement lives, and
- the explicit exception path for “no-CIP” backlog items.

## Detailed Description

### Human authorship and single-threaded accountability

Responsibility-bearing artifacts must have a **single primary accountable human**:
- CIPs require `author: "<Human Name>"`.
- Backlog tasks require `owner: "<Human Name>"`.
- Multi-person values like `"A, B"` or `"A and B"` are invalid for these fields.

This aligns with the tenet **human-authorship** (“AIs advise; humans decide”) by ensuring responsibility is never anonymous, collective, or delegated to tools.

### Option B: backlog → requirements exception (explicitly justified)

We keep the bottom-up default:
- Backlog links to CIPs (`related_cips`)
- CIPs link to requirements (`related_requirements`)
- Requirements link to tenets (`related_tenets`)

But we allow a **deliberate exception** for small bugfixes and low-design-change work:
- A backlog item may link directly to requirements (`related_requirements`) **only if**
  - `related_cips: []`, and
  - `no_cip_reason: "<non-empty justification>"`

This preserves a strict, auditable path while acknowledging pragmatic cases where a CIP is unnecessary.

### Governance drift warnings

We add a git-aware heuristic that warns when “implementation/tooling” files change without any corresponding updates to planning artifacts (CIP/backlog), to surface “we just encoded a policy in code without documenting it” at the moment it happens.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Policy encoding**
   - Enforce `author`/`owner` and single-threaded values in validation.
   - Add Option‑B exception enforcement (`no_cip_reason` + `related_cips: []`).
2. **Guardrails**
   - Add governance-drift warnings to validation and `whats-next` suggestions.
3. **Repo conformance**
   - Bring existing CIPs/backlog tasks into compliance (fill missing author/owner, remove forbidden downward links).

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing repositories with missing `author`/`owner` fields will fail validation until updated.
- Existing workflows remain compatible; the backlog→requirements path is allowed only with explicit justification.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests cover the new validation behavior (including multi-name rejection and the Option‑B exception).
- Run `scripts/validate_vibesafe_structure.py` on the repo to ensure no errors/warnings.

## Follow-ups

- **CIP-0016 (Proposed)**: Define a lightweight CoE (Cause of Error) process for governance/traceability incidents (how we analyze cause, classify severity, and generate mitigations/tripwires) so we prevent repeats of this “own goal” pattern.
