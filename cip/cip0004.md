# CIP-0004: Tenet System for Project Governance

## Status

- [x] Proposed: 2025-05-05
- [ ] Accepted
- [x] Implemented: 2026-01-03
- [x] Closed: 2026-01-03

## Closure Summary

**Closed 2026-01-03**: Core tenet system successfully implemented and in active use.

**What Was Completed**:
- ✅ Tenet directory structure and templates
- ✅ 6 VibeSafe example tenets created
- ✅ Tooling for combining tenets and generating cursor rules
- ✅ Documentation system complete
- ✅ Integration with installation process

**What Was Deferred**:
- Advanced lifecycle management (review cycles, status tracking)
- Usage tracking and conflict detection
- Tenet visualization tools
- Enhanced validation tools

**Where Deferred Work Lives**:
- **REQ-0004** (Sustainable and Relevant Tenets) - tracks advanced lifecycle features
- **CIP-0011** (Component Management) - includes tenet sustainability in its scope
- **Backlog**: `2026-01-03_tenets-sustainability-process` - implementation task

The basic tenet system is fully functional and accomplishes the original CIP goals. Enhanced features are properly tracked for future implementation.

## Description

This CIP proposes adding a standardised tenet system to VibeSafe, enabling projects to define, manage, and share their guiding principles. This mechanism would allow organizations to document their decision-making framework in a structured way, facilitating clearer communication and more consistent governance.

## Motivation

Many successful projects and organizations use tenets (or similar principles) to guide decision-making and communicate values. However:

1. There's no standardized structure for defining and managing tenets
2. Organizations often struggle with how to integrate tenets into their workflows
3. Tenets are rarely version-controlled or systematically updated
4. New team members have difficulty learning and applying tenets
5. Cross-team collaboration is hindered by misalignment on fundamental principles
6. Projects often create too many tenets, diluting their effectiveness
7. Tenets are frequently treated as supplementary rather than foundational

By providing a standardized system for managing tenets within VibeSafe, we can:

1. Help teams articulate their principles clearly
2. Create a consistent format for tenet documentation
3. Integrate tenets with project management workflows
4. Enable evolution of tenets over time with proper versioning
5. Facilitate sharing of tenets across teams and organizations
6. Encourage focus on a small set of core principles (typically around 7)
7. Promote placing tenets at the forefront of project identity and decision-making

## Implementation

### Core Principles for the Tenet System

The tenet system itself will follow these key principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Tenets should be few in number (typically 5-9) for memorability and focus
2. **Prominence**: Tenets should be placed at the forefront of projects, not buried in documentation
3. **Practicality**: Tenets should be applicable to real-world decisions, not abstract statements
4. **Evolving**: Tenets should be version-controlled and refined over time

### Repository Structure

```
vibesafe/
├── README.md                # Will include a link to tenets
├── backlog/
├── cip/
├── tenets/                  # New directory for tenet management
│   ├── README.md            # Overview of the tenet system
│   ├── tenet_template.md    # Template for creating new tenets
│   ├── tenets.md            # VibeSafe's own tenets (as an example)
│   └── tenets.yaml          # Machine-readable tenet definitions
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── tenets.mdc           # Cursor rule for tenet management
└── templates/
    └── tenets/              # Templates for tenet system
```

### Tenet Format

Each tenet would be defined with:

1. **ID**: A unique identifier for the tenet
2. **Title**: A concise phrase capturing the principle
3. **Description**: A paragraph explaining the principle and its application
4. **Memorable Quote**: A succinct statement that encapsulates the principle
5. **Examples**: Concrete examples of the tenet in action
6. **Counter-examples**: Examples of what violates the tenet
7. **Conflicts**: Common conflicts with other tenets and how to resolve them
8. **Version**: For tracking changes to the tenet over time

### Integration with Existing Systems

The tenet system will integrate with:

1. **CIP Process**: CIPs will include a section on tenet alignment
2. **Backlog**: Tasks can reference relevant tenets
3. **Documentation**: Projects can reference tenets in decision explanations
4. **Version Control**: Tenets will be tracked with proper versioning
5. **Project README**: Main project documentation will link to tenets prominently

### VibeSafe Example Tenets

As a demonstration, VibeSafe will define its own set of seven tenets, including:

1. **User Autonomy Over Prescription**
   - Example: Our gist integration system (CIP-0003) allows users to choose their preferred architecture rather than imposing a single approach
   - Counter-example: Forcing users to adopt a specific directory structure with no configuration options

(Additional tenets would be defined as examples)

### Tooling

The implementation will include:

1. **Tenet Validator**: Tool to check tenet document format and ensure appropriate number of tenets
2. **Tenet Linter**: Check for clear language and completeness
3. **Tenet Reference Checker**: Ensure references to tenets are valid
4. **Tenet Visualization**: Generate visual representations of tenet relationships
5. **README Integration**: Helpers to add tenet references to project README files

## Implementation Steps

1. Define the tenet document format (markdown and YAML)
2. Create templates for tenets
3. Implement tooling for tenet validation and visualization
4. Draft VibeSafe's own tenets as examples (limiting to ~7)
5. Update templates for CIPs and backlog tasks to include tenet references
6. Create cursor rule for tenet application
7. Document the tenet system and best practices
8. Update VibeSafe README to prominently feature tenets

## Implementation Status

### Core System (Completed - 2026-01-03)

- [x] Define tenet document format (Markdown with structured sections)
- [x] Create tenet templates (tenet_template.md)
- [x] Draft VibeSafe example tenets (6 tenets in tenets/vibesafe/)
- [x] Create cursor rule for tenets (automatic generation via combine_tenets.py)
- [x] Document the tenet system (comprehensive README.md)
- [x] Implement combine_tenets.py for merging and cursor rule generation
- [x] Integration with installation process

### Enhancements (Deferred to REQ-0004/CIP-0011)

- [ ] Standalone tenet validation tool (basic validation exists in combine_tenets.py)
- [ ] Update CIP and backlog templates with explicit tenet reference sections
- [ ] Tenet lifecycle management (review cycles, status tracking)
- [ ] Usage tracking and conflict detection
- [ ] Tenet visualization tool

**Note**: The core tenet system is fully functional and in active use. Deferred enhancements are tracked in REQ-0004 (Sustainable and Relevant Tenets) and will be implemented as part of CIP-0011.
