# CIP-0001: VibeSafe Project Management Templates

## Status

- [x] Proposed: 2025-05-05

## Description

This CIP proposes the initial structure and implementation of VibeSafe, a repository of standardized project management templates and practices.

## Motivation

Across various projects, we find ourselves repeatedly setting up similar project management structures. Each time, we're reinventing the wheel, which is inefficient and leads to inconsistency. 

By creating a standardized set of project management templates, we can:
1. Save time setting up new projects
2. Ensure consistency across projects
3. Provide a reference implementation for best practices
4. Make it easier for developers to move between projects

## Implementation

### Repository Structure

VibeSafe will follow a "dogfooding" approach - using its own practices while providing templates for other projects:

```
vibesafe/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── backlog/                  # Backlog system for VibeSafe itself
├── cip/                      # Code Improvement Plans for VibeSafe itself
├── .cursor/rules/            # Cursor rules for IDE integration
└── templates/                # Templates for other projects
    ├── backlog/              # Backlog system template
    ├── cip/                  # CIP system template
    └── .cursor/rules/        # Cursor rules templates
```

### Key Components

1. **Code Improvement Plans (CIPs)**
   - A structured approach to proposing, documenting, and implementing code improvements
   - Includes a template and documentation
   - Supports a workflow from proposal through implementation

2. **Backlog System**
   - A systematic way to track tasks, issues, and improvements
   - Organized into categories (documentation, infrastructure, features, bugs)
   - Includes scripts to maintain an index

3. **Cursor Rules**
   - Integration with the Cursor IDE for easier adoption
   - Rules explaining how to use the CIP and backlog systems

### Implementation Steps

1. Create the initial repository structure
2. Copy existing CIP and backlog templates from reference projects
3. Create clean templates in the templates/ directory
4. Write documentation on how to use VibeSafe
5. Set up VibeSafe to use its own systems for self-management

## Implementation Status

- [x] Create repository and initial structure
- [x] Set up CIP system
- [x] Set up backlog system
- [x] Create templates directory with clean versions
- [x] Document usage in README
- [x] Create example tasks in backlog
- [x] Set up GitHub repository for sharing
