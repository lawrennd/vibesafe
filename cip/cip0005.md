# CIP-0005: Enhanced Documentation-First Practices

## Status

- [x] Proposed: 2025-05-05
- [ ] Accepted
- [ ] Implemented
- [x] Closed: 2026-01-03 (Converted to REQ-0009)

## Reason for Closure: Converted to Requirement

**2026-01-03:** This CIP has been closed and converted to **REQ-0009 (High-Quality Documentation Standards)**.

**Why Converted:**
This CIP described desired outcomes (WHAT documentation should be like) rather than an implementation approach (HOW to achieve it). Using VibeSafe's WHAT vs HOW distinction:

- **WHAT (Requirement)**: "Documentation should be high-quality, consistent, and follow clear standards"
- **HOW (CIP)**: "Here's the specific system design for documentation validation tools and style guide infrastructure"

**What This Means:**
- **REQ-0009** now expresses the desired outcome (high-quality documentation)
- When ready to implement (after CIP-0011), a new CIP should be created describing HOW to build the documentation quality system
- The 7 dependent documentation backlog tasks now reference REQ-0009

**Benefits of Conversion:**
1. ✅ Properly separates WHAT (requirement) from HOW (implementation)
2. ✅ Removes confusing "requirements gathering" suggestion from whats-next
3. ✅ Allows proper priority/blocking relationships (REQ-0009 blocked by CIP-0011)
4. ✅ Dogfoods VibeSafe's own WHAT/HOW distinction

## Description

This CIP proposes improvements to VibeSafe's documentation practices to better align with our "Documentation as First-Class Citizen" tenet. It aims to standardize how we document options, alternatives, and implementation details across all VibeSafe components.

## Motivation

While our "Documentation as First-Class Citizen" tenet establishes documentation as a core value, we have inconsistent implementation across our systems:

1. Some CIPs (like CIP-0003) provide excellent documentation of options, pros/cons, and alternatives
2. Our CIP template doesn't explicitly guide users to document options in a standardized way
3. We have limited documentation-related tasks in our backlog
4. Our documentation doesn't consistently follow the "document first, implement second" principle

By enhancing our documentation practices, we can:

1. Ensure consistent, high-quality documentation across all VibeSafe components
2. Better demonstrate the "Documentation as First-Class Citizen" tenet in practice
3. Make it easier for users to understand and evaluate implementation options
4. Provide clearer guidance for contributors on documentation expectations
5. Create documentation that truly drives implementation

## Implementation

### 1. Enhance CIP Template

Update the CIP template (`cip_template.md`) to better support documentation-first development:

```diff
# CIP-XXXX: [Title]

### 2. Improve Backlog Documentation

Create additional documentation tasks in the backlog to ensure comprehensive documentation:

1. Create a style guide for VibeSafe documentation
2. Document each system (CIP, Backlog, Tenets) with dedicated guides
3. Create user personas and document common workflows for each
4. Develop a "Getting Started" guide for new VibeSafe users
5. Document integration patterns between different VibeSafe systems
6. Create tutorial-style documentation with step-by-step examples

### 3. Create a Documentation Checklist

Implement a standard checklist for all documentation:

```markdown
## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Written before or alongside implementation (not after)
- [ ] Includes clear examples of usage
- [ ] Documents all available options and configurations
- [ ] Provides pros/cons for different approaches
- [ ] Links to related documentation
- [ ] Tested for clarity with new users
- [ ] Follows VibeSafe documentation style guide
```

### 4. Document Documentation

Create meta-documentation explaining VibeSafe's documentation approach:

1. A guide to writing effective documentation following our tenet
2. Templates for different documentation types
3. Guidelines for maintaining documentation alongside code
4. Process for reviewing and improving documentation

### 5. VibeSafe README Enhancements

Enhance the main README to better showcase our documentation-first approach:

1. Add a dedicated "Documentation" section
2. Link to all major documentation sources
3. Include example-based quick start guides
4. Emphasize the documentation-first tenet in practice

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the CIP template with the enhanced sections
2. Create the documentation checklist and add it to templates
3. Add documentation tasks to the backlog
4. Write the documentation style guide
5. Update the README with the enhanced documentation section
6. Create the meta-documentation for documentation processes
7. Review and improve documentation across existing components

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Update CIP template
- [ ] Create documentation checklist
- [ ] Add documentation tasks to backlog
- [ ] Write documentation style guide
- [ ] Update README
- [ ] Create meta-documentation
- [ ] Review existing documentation

## Backward Compatibility

These changes enhance rather than break existing systems. They add new documentation requirements but don't invalidate existing documentation.

## Testing Strategy

Documentation improvements will be tested through:

1. User testing with new contributors
2. Peer reviews of documentation
3. Verification that documentation accurately describes implementation
4. Checking that examples work as documented

## Related CIPs

- **CIP-0011**: Simplify VibeSafe Component Management (should be implemented first)
- **Relationship**: CIP-0011 establishes component structure; CIP-0005 establishes documentation quality standards. Complementary but CIP-0011 provides necessary foundation.
