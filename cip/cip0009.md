# CIP-0009: Requirements Conversation Framework

## Status

- [x] Proposed: 2025-05-08
- [x] Accepted
- [x] Implemented: 2025-05-12
- [x] Closed: 2026-01-03

## Closure Summary

**Closed 2026-01-03**: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework fully implemented and in active use.

**What Was Completed**:
- ✅ Complete directory structure: `ai-requirements/` with all components
- ✅ All 4 prompt templates: discovery, refinement, validation, testing
- ✅ Conversation patterns: stakeholder identification, goal decomposition
- ✅ Integration with CIP system (cip-integration.md)
- ✅ Integration with backlog system (backlog-integration.md)
- ✅ Cursor rules created (requirements_rule.md and .mdc)
- ✅ Project templates updated (templates/ai-requirements/)
- ✅ Examples and guidance documentation
- ✅ Framework documentation and README

**Impact**:
The AI-Requirements Framework is now a core part of VibeSafe, providing structured approaches for AI-assisted requirements gathering. The framework has been tested through self-referential use (creating requirements for its own development) and is integrated with both the CIP and backlog systems.

**Note**: The implementation status checklist in this CIP was not fully updated during implementation, but verification (2026-01-03) confirms all components exist and are functional. This is common pattern we've seen - implementation completes but status tracking lags behind.

## Implementation

The AI-Requirements Framework has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. *Directory Structure*:
   ```
   ai-requirements/
   ├── README.md                 # Framework overview
   ├── patterns/                 # Reusable conversation patterns
   │   ├── stakeholder-identification.md
   │   └── goal-decomposition.md
   ├── prompts/                  # Prompts for different stages
   │   ├── discovery/            # Initial requirements discovery
   │   ├── refinement/           # Requirements refinement
   │   ├── validation/           # Requirements validation
   │   └── testing/              # Testing requirements
   ├── integrations/             # Integration with other components
   │   ├── cip-integration.md
   │   ├── backlog-integration.md
   │   └── common/
   │       ├── traceability.md
   │       └── status-sync.md
   ├── examples/                 # Example conversations
   └── guidance/                 # Additional guidance
   ```

2. *Key Components*:
   - *Patterns*: Implemented stakeholder identification and goal decomposition patterns
   - *Prompts*: Created prompts for all four stages of requirements process
   - *Integrations*: Implemented integration with both CIP and backlog systems
   - *Examples*: Created multiple examples showing the framework in action
   - *Documentation*: Comprehensive documentation in README and other files

3. *Integration with VibeSafe*:
   - Added to the default installation script (CIP-000C)
   - Integrated with the What's Next script for status tracking
   - Fully documented in the project templates

4. *Testing*:
   - The framework has been tested through self-referential use, creating requirements for its own development
   - Validated through real-world use creating backlog tasks and CIPs

This implementation follows Option 4: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework from the original proposal, providing a comprehensive set of tools for AI-assisted requirements gathering.

## Summary

This CIP proposes adding a framework to VibeSafe for facilitating structured requirements conversations with users, especially when starting from scratch on a new software project. The framework will provide standardized approaches to elicit, document, and validate requirements using natural language conversations, drawing inspiration from recent research on requirements-driven end-user software engineering.

## Motivation

When starting a new software project, the most critical phase is understanding and documenting user requirements. However, VibeSafe currently lacks a formal structure for:

1. Guiding productive requirements conversations with users
2. Documenting requirements in a structured yet accessible format
3. Validating that the requirements meet user needs before implementation
4. Handling evolving requirements during the project lifecycle
5. Leveraging natural language as the primary interface for requirements

The Robinson et al. paper "Requirements are All You Need: The Final Frontier for End-User Software Engineering" (2024) highlights how generative AI can transform the software development process to be more accessible to end-users through natural language requirements. VibeSafe should incorporate these insights to enable a more user-centered approach to requirements gathering.

By implementing a requirements conversation framework, VibeSafe will:

1. Reduce the gap between user needs and implemented features
2. Create a structured record of requirements decisions
3. Enable non-technical stakeholders to participate meaningfully in the requirements process
4. Provide guidance for structuring requirements conversations
5. Leverage the potential of natural language in software development

## Detailed Description

The Requirements Conversation Framework will consist of several interconnected components:

1. *Conversation Templates*: Structured templates for different types of requirements conversations (e.g., initial discovery, feature refinement, acceptance criteria).

2. *Requirements Documentation Format*: A standardized format for documenting requirements that balances structure with accessibility.

3. *Validation Mechanisms*: Methods to validate that requirements are complete, consistent, and reflective of user needs.

4. *Integration Points*: How requirements feed into other VibeSafe components like CIPs and the backlog system.

5. *Evolving Requirements Handling*: Processes for managing changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Standalone Requirements Module

This approach would add a new top-level module to VibeSafe specifically for requirements conversations.

#### Proposed Structure

```

│   └── integration/                 # Integration guides for other VibeSafe components
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── requirements.mdc             # New cursor rule for requirements
└── templates/
    └── requirements/                # Project templates including requirements components
```

#### Pros

- *Clear separation*: Requirements have their own dedicated module
- *Comprehensive coverage*: Can fully develop all aspects of requirements gathering
- *Discoverability*: Easy to find and use as a top-level component

#### Cons

- *Potential isolation*: May not integrate seamlessly with existing components
- *Learning overhead*: Users need to learn another separate subsystem
- *Duplication risk*: Some concepts may overlap with backlog or CIP systems

### Option 2: Requirements Extension to Backlog System

This approach would extend the existing backlog system to include structured requirements conversations.

#### Proposed Structure

```
vibesafe/
├── README.md
├── backlog/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── task_template.md
│   ├── requirements/               # New requirements section in backlog
│   │   ├── README.md               # Overview of requirements approach
│   │   ├── conversation_guides/    # Templates for requirements conversations
│   │   └── examples/               # Example requirements documents
│   ├── update_index.py
│   └── ...                         # Existing backlog structure
├── cip/
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── backlog.mdc                 # Updated to include requirements guidance
└── templates/
    └── backlog/                    # Updated to include requirements components
```

#### Pros

- *Integration*: Directly connects requirements to the task management system
- *Familiar workflow*: Users already familiar with backlog can extend their knowledge
- *Traceability*: Clear path from requirements to implementation tasks

#### Cons

- *Limited scope*: May constrain the requirements framework to fit backlog patterns
- *Identity confusion*: Requirements gathering is distinct from backlog management
- *Organizational challenges*: Requirements conversations have different dynamics than task tracking

### Option 3: Cross-Component Natural Language Framework

This approach would implement a natural language requirements framework that spans multiple VibeSafe components, providing consistent interfaces across CIPs, backlog, and other modules.

#### Proposed Structure

```
vibesafe/
├── README.md
├── backlog/
│   └── ...                         # Enhanced with requirements connections
├── cip/
│   └── ...                         # Enhanced with requirements connections
├── nl-requirements/                # Natural language requirements framework
│   ├── README.md                   # Overview of the framework
│   ├── patterns/                   # Reusable conversation patterns
│   ├── connectors/                 # Integration with other VibeSafe components
│   │   ├── backlog_connector.py    # Connect requirements to backlog
│   │   ├── cip_connector.py        # Connect requirements to CIPs
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── conversations/              # Templates for different conversation types
│   └── examples/                   # Example requirements documents for different contexts
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── nl-requirements.mdc         # Cursor rule for requirements conversations
└── templates/
    └── ...                         # All templates updated with requirements components
```

#### Pros

- *Holistic approach*: Requirements as a cross-cutting concern across all components
- *Context sensitivity*: Can adapt to different contexts (backlog, CIP, etc.)
- *Flexibility*: Can evolve alongside all other VibeSafe components
- *Natural language focus*: Centered on the conversational aspect of requirements gathering

#### Cons

- *Complexity*: More complex to implement and maintain
- *Consistency challenges*: Ensuring consistent behavior across different components
- *Learning curve*: Understanding where to use which parts of the framework

### Option 4: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework

Building on Option 3, this approach would specifically design the requirements framework to leverage modern AI capabilities, positioning VibeSafe as a bridge between human-driven and AI-assisted software development practices.

#### Proposed Structure

```
vibesafe/
├── README.md
├── backlog/
├── cip/
├── ai-requirements/               # AI-assisted requirements framework
│   ├── README.md                  # Overview of the AI-assisted framework
│   ├── prompts/                   # Carefully designed prompts for different requirements contexts
│   │   ├── discovery.md           # Initial requirements discovery prompts
│   │   ├── refinement.md          # Requirements refinement prompts
│   │   ├── validation.md          # Requirements validation prompts
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── patterns/                  # Conversation patterns and flows
│   ├── integrations/              # Integration with AI tools and VibeSafe components
│   ├── examples/                  # Example AI-assisted requirements conversations
│   └── guidance/                  # Human guidance for working with AI on requirements
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── ai-requirements.mdc        # Cursor rule for AI-assisted requirements
└── templates/
    └── ...                        # Templates updated with AI-requirements components
```

## Selected Approach

Based on the analysis, *Option 4: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework* is recommended because:

1. It aligns with the future direction of software development as described in the Robinson et al. paper
2. It provides flexibility to integrate with all VibeSafe components
3. It explicitly addresses the growing role of AI in requirements gathering
4. It maintains user autonomy by providing guidance rather than prescription
5. It can be implemented incrementally, starting with core functionality

This approach puts VibeSafe at the forefront of requirements-driven end-user software engineering while maintaining VibeSafe's core principles of user autonomy and simplicity.

## Implementation Plan

1. *Foundation (Phase 1)*:
   - Create the basic directory structure
   - Develop initial README and documentation
   - Design core prompt templates for basic requirements conversations
   - Establish integration points with CIP and backlog systems

2. *Core Functionality (Phase 2)*:
   - Implement prompt library for different requirements contexts
   - Create example conversations showing the framework in action
   - Develop guidelines for requirements documentation
   - Build validation checklist and procedures

3. *Integration (Phase 3)*:
   - Build connectors to CIP and backlog systems
   - Create Cursor rules for AI-assisted requirements conversations
   - Update project templates to include requirements components
   - Develop training materials and documentation

4. *Advanced Features (Phase 4)*:
   - Implement mechanisms for tracking evolving requirements
   - Create tools for requirements validation
   - Build visualization components for requirements relationships
   - Develop metrics for requirements quality and completeness

## Backward Compatibility

The introduction of the requirements framework will not disrupt existing VibeSafe systems. Instead, it will:

1. Enhance the context for CIPs by providing clearer requirements connections
2. Provide richer context for backlog tasks
3. Add new capabilities without modifying existing functionality

Users can adopt the requirements framework incrementally without needing to change their existing practices.

## Testing Strategy

The requirements framework will be tested through:

1. *Example projects*: Creating full requirements conversations for sample projects
2. *User feedback*: Gathering feedback from users on the effectiveness of the templates
3. *Integration testing*: Verifying connections to backlog and CIPs work correctly
4. *AI interaction testing*: Testing the framework with different AI tools and models

## Documentation Plan

1. *User documentation*:
   - Guide to conducting effective requirements conversations
   - Templates for different types of requirements discussions
   - Examples of well-documented requirements
   - Guidelines for working with AI on requirements

2. *Developer documentation*:
   - Framework architecture and design decisions
   - Integration points with other VibeSafe components
   - Extension mechanisms for customizing the framework

3. *Integration documentation*:
   - How requirements feed into CIPs and backlog tasks
   - Tracing implementations back to requirements
   - Handling evolving requirements throughout the project lifecycle
