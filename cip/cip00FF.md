# CIP-000E: Implement AI-Assisted Requirements Framework

## Summary
This CIP defines the implementation approach for the AI-Assisted Requirements Framework, which will provide tools, templates, patterns, and prompts to help users capture, refine, validate, and track requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Motivation
Requirements engineering is often challenging, especially for teams without specialized expertise. By creating an AI-assisted framework that bridges natural language requirements and technical implementation, we can improve project outcomes and reduce the gap between stakeholder needs and delivered solutions.

## Detailed Description
The AI-Assisted Requirements Framework will consist of the following components:

1. **Templates**: Standardized document templates for requirements with YAML frontmatter
2. **Directory Structure**: Organized structure for requirements artifacts
3. **Prompts**: AI conversation prompts for different requirements activities
4. **Patterns**: Reusable conversation structures for common requirements scenarios
5. **Integration Components**: Connectors to CIPs and backlog
6. **Examples**: Sample documents demonstrating framework use
7. **Guidance**: Best practices for using the framework

The framework will support the full requirements lifecycle including:
- Discovery (initial requirements gathering)
- Refinement (detailing and clarifying requirements)
- Validation (checking requirements for quality)
- Testing (creating validation criteria)
- Implementation tracking
- Status synchronization

## Implementation Plan
The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**:
   - Create directory structure
   - Develop requirement template with YAML frontmatter
   - Define status workflow and integration points
   - Create basic documentation

2. **Patterns & Prompts Phase**:
   - Implement goal decomposition pattern
   - Implement stakeholder identification pattern
   - Create discovery prompts
   - Create refinement prompts
   - Create validation prompts
   - Create testing prompts

3. **Integration Phase**:
   - Create CIP integration mechanism
   - Create backlog integration mechanism
   - Implement status synchronization
   - Enhance What's Next script to check requirements status

4. **Guidance & Examples Phase**:
   - Create example requirements
   - Develop guidance documentation
   - Implement examples of integration

## Backward Compatibility
The framework will be designed to coexist with existing VibeSafe components. It will:
- Use consistent metadata formats (YAML frontmatter)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Integrate with existing scripts and tools
- Support incremental adoption

## Testing Strategy
Testing will include:
- Validation of template structure
- Verification of integration with CIPs and backlog
- Testing What's Next script with requirements status
- User testing with AI assistants to validate prompts and patterns

## Related Requirements
This CIP addresses the following requirements:

- [REQ-002: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework](../ai-requirements/ai-requirements-framework.md)

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- Requirements template with consistent metadata
- Directory structure for requirements artifacts
- Prompts and patterns for the requirements process
- Integration with other VibeSafe components
- Status tracking throughout the requirements lifecycle
