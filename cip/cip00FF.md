# CIP-000E: Implement AI-Assisted Requirements Framework

## Summary
This CIP defines the implementation approach for the AI-Assisted Requirements Framework, which will provide tools, templates, patterns, and prompts to help users capture, refine, validate, and track requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Motivation
Requirements engineering is often challenging, especially for teams without specialized expertise. By creating an AI-assisted framework that bridges natural language requirements and technical implementation, we can improve project outcomes and reduce the gap between stakeholder needs and delivered solutions.

## Detailed Description
The AI-Assisted Requirements Framework will consist of the following components:

1. **Templates**: Standardized document templates for requirements with YAML frontmatter
2. **Directory Structure**: Organized structure for requirements artifacts
3. **Prompts**: AI conversation prompts for different requirements activities
4. **Patterns**: Reusable conversation structures for common requirements scenarios
5. **Integration Components**: Connectors to CIPs and backlog
6. **Examples**: Sample documents demonstrating framework use
7. **Guidance**: Best practices for using the framework

The framework will support the full requirements lifecycle including:
- Discovery (initial requirements gathering)
- Refinement (detailing and clarifying requirements)
- Validation (checking requirements for quality)
- Testing (creating validation criteria)
- Implementation tracking
- Status synchronization

## Implementation Plan
The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**:
   - ‚úÖ Create directory structure
   - ‚úÖ Develop requirement template with YAML frontmatter
   - üîÑ Define status workflow and integration points
   - ‚è≥ Create basic documentation

2. **Patterns & Prompts Phase**:
   - ‚è≥ Implement goal decomposition pattern
   - ‚è≥ Implement stakeholder identification pattern
   - ‚è≥ Create discovery prompts
   - ‚è≥ Create refinement prompts
   - ‚è≥ Create validation prompts
   - ‚è≥ Create testing prompts

3. **Integration Phase**:
   - ‚è≥ Create CIP integration mechanism
   - ‚è≥ Create backlog integration mechanism
   - ‚è≥ Implement status synchronization
   - ‚è≥ Enhance What's Next script to check requirements status

4. **Guidance & Examples Phase**:
   - ‚è≥ Create example requirements
   - ‚è≥ Develop guidance documentation
   - ‚è≥ Implement examples of integration

## Backward Compatibility
The framework will be designed to coexist with existing VibeSafe components. It will:
- Use consistent metadata formats (YAML frontmatter)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Integrate with existing scripts and tools
- Support incremental adoption

## Testing Strategy
Testing will include:
- Validation of template structure
- Verification of integration with CIPs and backlog
- Testing What's Next script with requirements status
- User testing with AI assistants to validate prompts and patterns

## Related Requirements
This CIP addresses the following requirements:

- [REQ-002: AI-Assisted Requirements Framework](../ai-requirements/ai-requirements-framework.md)

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- Requirements template with consistent metadata
- Directory structure for requirements artifacts
- Prompts and patterns for the requirements process
- Integration with other VibeSafe components
- Status tracking throughout the requirements lifecycle

## Implementation Status
- üîÑ Foundation Phase (In Progress)
  - ‚úÖ Directory structure created
  - ‚úÖ Requirement template implemented
  - üîÑ Status workflow in progress
  - ‚è≥ Documentation pending
- ‚è≥ Patterns & Prompts Phase (Not Started)
- ‚è≥ Integration Phase (Not Started)
- ‚è≥ Guidance & Examples Phase (Not Started)

# AI-Requirements Framework Integration

## Abstract

This CIP proposes the integration of the AI-Requirements framework into the VibeSafe development process, establishing a structured approach to requirements gathering, validation, and management.

## Motivation

The current development process lacks a systematic approach to requirements gathering and validation. The AI-Requirements framework provides a structured methodology for:
- Gathering requirements through AI-assisted conversations
- Validating requirements against best practices
- Managing requirements throughout the development lifecycle
- Integrating requirements with CIPs and backlog items

## Specification

### Foundation Phase

1. Directory Structure ‚úÖ
   - Create `ai-requirements/` directory
   - Create subdirectories for patterns, prompts, integrations, examples, and guidance
   - Status: Completed

2. Requirement Template ‚úÖ
   - Develop requirement template with YAML frontmatter
   - Define required fields and validation rules
   - Status: Completed

3. Status Workflow
   - Define status transitions for requirements
   - Implement status validation
   - Status: In Progress

4. Basic Documentation
   - Document the framework structure
   - Create usage guidelines
   - Status: Not Started

### Integration Phase

1. CIP Integration
   - Link requirements to CIPs
   - Track requirement status in CIPs
   - Status: Not Started

2. Backlog Integration
   - Link requirements to backlog items
   - Track requirement status in backlog
   - Status: Not Started

3. Validation Rules
   - Define validation rules for requirements
   - Implement validation checks
   - Status: Not Started

### Enhancement Phase

1. AI-Assisted Requirements
   - Implement AI-assisted requirements gathering
   - Create prompt templates
   - Status: Not Started

2. Requirements Testing
   - Define requirements testing methodology
   - Implement test templates
   - Status: Not Started

3. Requirements Metrics
   - Define requirements metrics
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Status: Not Started

## Rationale

The AI-Requirements framework provides a structured approach to requirements management that:
- Ensures consistency in requirements gathering
- Validates requirements against best practices
- Tracks requirements throughout the development lifecycle
- Integrates with existing CIP and backlog processes

## Backwards Compatibility

This CIP is backwards compatible as it:
- Preserves existing CIP and backlog formats
- Adds new fields and structures without breaking existing ones
- Maintains compatibility with existing tools and processes

## Security Considerations

The AI-Requirements framework must:
- Protect sensitive information in requirements
- Validate requirements for security implications
- Track security-related requirements
